Goal: Create a app/website that will allow for tracking of 
goals and aid in the formation of habbits. 

Allows for a 'board like' scenario where titles can be 
rearraged to make what could be a room layout. (As in a gym, showing the 
current progress on each machine in a simple to understand layout of gym)

Shows the goal for a reminder on load up of the app. 
"I want to lose 50lbs" Potentially showing progress to achieving that 
goal, however might be offputting if far away. 

Allow for super customisable goals, this is not a gym/well being app. 
It should be useful for a varierty of use cases. 

Automatic sync with the website utilising google login. 

Sleak design. Nothing too intrusive or which would indicate a 'best use case'. 
Allow the user to use as they want.  Potentially an issue, as no clear defined 
goals can introduce project creep. 

Allow lists to be made, useful for shopping, weight sets, household chores etc. 

Allow for creation of profile import and export (like wow addons) to share setups 
with others. Potentially ugly, utilise the profile system better and allow for user 
created content on a store like interface.

  ✓  Add a nav bar.

  X  Change the list item to a text box so when its added to the containment
    it can have more information.
    
  ✓  Solve why the items in the containment are not allowed to go all the way
    to the right.

  ✓ Change the navbar so it changes on scroll down

  X Change the list item to a text box so when its added to the containment
  it can have more information. - NOT DOING THIS ANYMORE, NOT REALLY NEEDED
